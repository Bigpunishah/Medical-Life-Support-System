By Vikel Cunningham

LifeSupportSystem.java - is the main file to launch for the application to run.


List of BUGS: 

#1 : In the model classes such as Patient.java & MedicalEmployee.java have a bug when it comes to using Scanner: sc.nextInt() around other print
statements that use ... = sc.nextLine(). Was able to fix when moving the `age = sc.nextInt()` to the bottom of the list of print statements. I moved back to the position of error because the flow I want the user to enter their age is around the first couple of questions.

#2 : 



This is a life support system that allows you to keep a patient alive.
